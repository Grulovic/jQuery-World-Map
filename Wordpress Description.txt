-jQuery UI:

	For the jQuery UI i have used datepicker for the form birthday input in order to make date chosing easier.
	
	I have also used a custom theme made on the jQuery UI Themeroller (http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/).
	
	Besides the validation in form_validation.js, the UI options are used also for the validation. Where to user is not allowed to chose a date bigger than todays date, with combinations on on click option that it removes the date written, the user is error trapped.
